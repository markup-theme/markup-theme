**test term**

.. term-test-start

This is an example paragraph that shows how to use snippets to include content in more than one spot. Sometimes it's easier to manage lots of snippets when they can be alongside each other, like in this file. This works great for glossary terms (that are also usable as top-level introductions). List them alphabetically for fun and profit.
