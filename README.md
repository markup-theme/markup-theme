# Readme

The MARKUP theme is a custom theme for Sphinx that combines a bespoke left-side navigation and site-wide top-level navigation that allows for large collections of Sphinx projects to be unified under a single site layout. If you have only one Sphinx docs project, this theme is probably not for you; however, if you have dozens, you might find it helpful.

See /markup_theme/markup_theme/source/index.rst file for setup and configuration details.
