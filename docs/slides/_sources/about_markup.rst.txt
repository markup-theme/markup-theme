    * Supports RevealJS HTML presentations (similar to PowerPoint, but in HTML)
    * Supports using Docutils directives in Markdown!
    * Supports printing HTML output to PDF via a sub-theme

 .. revealjs:: Why the MARKUP Theme?
    :data-transition: none

    Why not? This project and theme exist to enable an open source documentation platform with simple tooling that has a better starting point than most other Sphinx projects. The MARKUP theme embraces single-source principles found in more traditional content management systems used by technical writers and technical writing teams, but without requiring proprietary lock-in or dedicated editing interfaces or XML formatting.
