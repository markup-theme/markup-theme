==================================================
Sass
==================================================

Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a style sheet language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sassy CSS files use block formatting similar to CSS and enables the use of variables. Sass will save these preprocessed files as a normal CSS file to use with any static site generated by |theme|. Use a command shell to compile Sassy CSS files into CSS using the ``sass`` command. This command must tell Sass the files from which to build, and then the location to which the CSS is output.

Sassy CSS
==================================================

|theme| is already set up to use `Sass <https://sass-lang.com/>`__. You will need to `download and install Sass <https://sass-lang.com/install>`__ to make changes to the style sheet. Highly recommended!

.. note:: You could switch this to be managed by another favorite CSS manager, such as `Less <http://lesscss.org/>`__. However, documentation for |theme| does not provide any tips on how to do that.

**To manage Sassy CSS files**

#. Install Sass: http://sass-lang.com/install
#. Open a command shell and navigate to the ``_themes/markup/static`` directory.
#. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sass --watch scss/markup.scss:markup.css_t

   This will watch the Sassy CSS files located in the ``_themes/markup/static/scss`` directory for changes.

#. Use your favorite text editor to make changes to Sassy CSS files. When saved, Sass will update the CSS file used by |theme|.


.. _css-sassy-files:

Sassy CSS Files
--------------------------------------------------

Sassy CSS files are located in the ``_themes/markup/static/scss`` directory:

* ``_config.scss`` defines template variables for managing colors, fonts, and some other things.
* ``_nav-docs.scss`` defines the styles and presentation for the left-side navigation tree.
* ``_nav.scss`` defines the navigation that exists across the top of the site.
* ``_reset.scss`` should not be modified; it's the backup file in case (for whatever reason) a style doesn't work.
* ``_sidebar-ad.scss`` should not be modified.
* ``_sphinx.scss`` defines the styles and presentation for the actual documentation page.
* ``_version-picker.scss`` is unused in the current theme.
* ``markup.scss`` should only be modified when additiona custom underscore-prefixed pages are added to the Sass templates directory

The underscore-prefixed files are aggregated into the file located at ``_themes/markup/static/markup.css_t`` and are managed by the ``markup.scss`` file to generate the CSS file that is used by the theme for presenting the layout of the docs website.


.. _css-sass-updates:

Sass Updates
==================================================

You will want to make the following updates right away when using |theme|:

#. Recommended. :ref:`Update colors for your site <css-sass-update-site-colors>`.
#. Optional. :ref:`Update the path <css-sass-update-config-path>` in the Sassy CSS config file.



.. _css-sass-update-site-colors:

Site Colors
--------------------------------------------------

Site colors are defined using variables. You can change a color in one spot, and then when Sass generates the updated CSS file all of the locations in which that variable is defined are also updated.

**To update site colors**

#. Open a command shell and navigate to the ``_themes/markup/static`` directory.
#. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sass --watch scss/markup.scss:markup.css_t

#. Open the ``_config.scss`` file in your favorite text editor.
#. Review the contents of the ``_config.scss`` file. It contains a list of variables with assigned colors. Colors are grouped below comments that describe that that color group is used for.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: css

      /*
       * The following are the primary colors. Use red and yellow sparingly.
       */

      $markup-red: #f06543;
      $markup-dark-blue: #1e2022;
      $markup-blue-grey: #c9d6df;
      $markup-bright-yellow: #f9e784;

      /*
       * The following map directly to navigation and default styles; 
       * these are a mix of primary, secondary, and tetrad colors
       */

      $markup-companyname: #1e2022;
      $markup-header: #1e2022;
      $markup-header-underline: #1e2022;
      $markup-left-nav-active: #0353a4;
      $markup-nav-rollover: #98999a;
      $markup-topnav-rollover: #1e2022;
      $markup-link: #1e2022;
      $markup-none: #ffffff;
      $markup-rollover: #c9d6df;
      $markup-subheaders: #ffffff;
      $markup-table-border: #1e2022;
      $markup-sidebar: #1e2022;
      $markup-white: #ffffff;
      $markup-lightbluegrey-background: #fbfcfd;
      $markup-bluegrey-background: #edf2f5;

#. Change the color values--``#f06543``, for example--to any values you want.

   .. tip:: It is recommended to start with changes to the colors under the "primary color" and "navigation and default styles" groupings. These are the colors that most directly map to your organization's preferred color scheme.

#. If a variable name needs to be changed, such as ``$markup-red`` to ``$markup-reddish``, you will need to update that variable name across all of the Sassy CSS files with a file name that begins with an underscore.


.. _css-sass-update-config-path:

Config Path
--------------------------------------------------

The configuration path is added as a comment and exists as a reference for potential users of Sass. It probably does not need to be updated, but you should verify and make sure it's accurate for your purposes. The comment is located at the top of the ``markup.css`` file:

.. code-block:: css

   // TO COMPILE CSS 
   // In command line switch to _themes/markup/static/ and run:
   // sass --watch scss/markup.scss:markup.css_t


**To verify the config path**

#. Open a command shell and navigate to the ``_themes/markup/static`` directory.
#. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sass --watch scss/markup.scss:markup.css_t

#. Open the ``markup.css`` file in your favorite text editor.
#. Verify the following lines and make any necessary updates:

   .. code-block:: css

      // In command line switch to _themes/markup/static/ and run:
      // sass --watch scss/markup.scss:markup.css_t
